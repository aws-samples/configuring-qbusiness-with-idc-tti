# Sample web application to demonstrate Trusted Token Propagation with AWS IAM Identity Center

You can use this sample web application to see demonstrate how Trusted Token Propagation Authorization Flow works with AWS IAM Identity Center.

## Getting started
1. Review [Configuring Amazon Q Business with AWS IAM Identity Center trusted identity propagation](../docs/tutorials/idc/intro-idc-tti.md)
2. Depending on the choice of your identity provider follow one of the end-to-end tutorials:
    * _**Okta:**_ [Configuring sample web application with Okta](../docs/tutorials/okta/config-webapp-using-okta.md)
    * _**Microsoft Entra:**_ [Configuring sample web application with Microsoft Entra](../docs/tutorials/entra/config-webapp-using-entra.md)

## Registering sample web application with OIDC compliant identity provider
Use the callback and logout URLs below, while registering the sample application with OIDC identity provider (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Amazon Cognito). When run from your workstation, by default, the sample web application will use `localhost` for domain name and `8080` for port.
* **Callback URL:** `http://<domain_name>:<port>/authorization-code/callback`
* **Logout URL (Optional):** `http://<domain_name>:<port>/logout`

### Trusted Token Issuer URI, Audience ID, Client ID and Client Secret
When you register your web application with OIDC identity provider, the identity provider generates a `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Audience ID`. You will need these to identity your application with the identity provider when making requests to obtain ID tokens. For most identity providers, by default, will use `Client ID` for `Audience ID`, if not explicitly stated.

Identity providers host an authorization server and makes available a `Token Issuer URI` for applications to invoke to authorize users and obtain ID tokens. The default `token issuer URI` for some of the common identity providers and how to find them are listed below:

#### Trusted token issuer URI by identity provider
* _**Okta:**_ `https://<okta_domain>/oauth2/default`
    * For details see [How to find Okta Issuer URI](../docs/tutorials/okta/find-okta-issuer-url.md)
* _**Microsoft Entra:**_ `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`
    * For details see [How to find Microsoft Entra Issuer URI](../docs/tutorials/entra/find-entra-issuer-url.md) 
* _**Amazon Cognito:**_ `https://cognito-idp.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/<cognito_user_pool_id>`

## Configure Web application Configuration
The required parameters for sample Web Application are configured via `.env` stored in `<project_home>/webapp/config/` folder. A template of the env file is available in folder for reference. Rename `.env.okta.dist`, `.env.entra.dist` or `.env.cognito.dist` to `.env` and update the env file attribute values as needed. A brief description of the attributes are provided below.

```
# OAuth client configuration
# Validate issuer url using '<issuer_url>/.well-known/openid-configuration'
issuer_url=<Trusted Token Issuer URI>
client_id=<OIDC client ID>
client_secret=<OIDC client secret>

# Application configuration
idc_provider_apl_arn=arn:aws:sso::<idc_acc_id>:application/ssoins-<idc_instance_id>/apl-<idc_provider_application_id>
qb_sts_role=arn:aws:iam::<app_acc_id>:role/<role_name>
qb_apl_id=<qbusiness_application_id>
app_domain=<hostname>:<port>
region_name=<aws_region_name>
```

The environment file (`.env`) has two sections: Oauth client and application configuration.
#### OAuth Client Configuration:
* **issuer_url:** The _issuer_url_ is the primary URL hosted by OIDC Identity Provider to facilitate discovery, and authorization and identity token generation. Refer to `Registering sample web application with OIDC compliant identity provider` section for examples of issuer_url for your IdP provider.
* **client_id:** The _client_id_ is a public identifier for apps. A unique ID is generated by your IdP when creating n OIDC Web App.
* **client_secret:** The _client_secret_ is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server. The secret is generated by your IdP when creating n OIDC Web App.

#### Application Configuration:
* **idc_provider_apl_arn:** ARN for IAM Identity Center custom application auth provider. This is the output of _CloudFormation template for configuring AWS IAM Identity Center_. For more information see [CFN README](../cf/README.md)
* **qb_sts_role:** ARN of IAM Role used by STS `AssumeRole` API. This is the output of _CloudFormation template for configuring your application_. For more information see [CFN README](../cf/README.md)
* **qb_apl_id:** Amazon Q Business application id
* **app_domain:** Hostname and port of the domain where this sample web application is hosted. If running locally use `localhost:8080`
* **region_name:** AWS region name where your Amazon Q Business application is deployed. Example `us-east-1` or `us-west-2`.
